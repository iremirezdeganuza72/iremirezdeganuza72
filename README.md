### Hi there üëã, I'm I√±igo üë®‚Äçüíª

I am passionate about data and have spent my entire professional career working with data analysis in the commercial departments of different companies, always using business intelligence tools. Now I have thrown myself into the wonderful world of programming, data analysis, Machine learning training algorithms, Neural Networks and Artificial Intelligence applications.
